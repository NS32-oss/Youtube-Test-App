This project is an advanced backend development initiative I am working on, utilizing Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and several other technologies. It encompasses all essential features of a comprehensive backend system. I am developing a fully functional video hosting platform, akin to YouTube, which includes functionalities such as user authentication (login, signup), video uploads, interaction capabilities (like, dislike, comment, reply), subscription management (subscribe, unsubscribe), and much more.

In this project, I adhere to industry best practices, incorporating JWT for secure authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and implementing robust access and refresh token mechanisms. This extensive project has been meticulously developed to ensure it covers all critical aspects of backend development. By working on this project, I aim to gain in-depth knowledge and practical experience in building a sophisticated backend system from the ground up.
